# Sorting algorithms in Go

This repository contains the ordering algorithms studied in Algorithms and Data Structures II and translated into the Go language, aiming to be used as an example of code in Go in the presentation of the language work in the subject Programming Languages of the Computer Science course at Pontifical Catholic University of Minas Gerais.

# How to compile

## Requirements

1- Check if the Go Language compiler is installed on your computer by running the following command in the terminal (in Windows, command prompt):

```
go version
```

2- If the Go Language compiler is not installed, install through this link: https://golang.org/doc/install.

## Compiling

1- Download this git repository's [zip file](https://github.com/Henriquemcc/Algoritmos_de_ordenacao_em_Go/archive/main.zip).

2- Unzip the zip file.

3- Open the terminal on the 'src' folder, which is inside the extracted folder and type the following command:

```
go build main.go
```

4- The executable binary object will be located in the folder where it was compiled ('src') with the name main (or main.exe on Windows).
